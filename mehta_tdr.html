            <p>In the simplest terms, as ZB is to CFOP, Mehta-TDR is to Mehta. Mehta-TDR solves the cube after EO-Ledge in 2 steps instead of 3, but at the cost of bumping up the algorithm count to almost 900. Compared to ZB, TDR is more efficient, has better recognition, and better algorithms and ergonomics. But since ZB itself hasn't made anywhere close to the top spots in cubing, this comparison doesn't achieve much.</p>

            <p>Getting a few abbreviations and definitions out of the way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>TDR:</b> Trang's DR block; a ~10 STM algorithm which is usually RU-gen and occasionally RUD-gen, to solve the remaining 3 D-layer pieces on the 3x3x3 after EO-ledge, achieveing a psuedo-F2L state with EO done. It has 350 cases.</li> 
                <li><b>ZBLL:</b> Zborowski-Bruchem Last Layer; a ~15 STM algorithm to solve the last layer after EO and F2L (or pF2L) have been done. It has 493 cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All of the TDR algorithms can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q5zlurWbYCpLzPpehkXrGQ0ab5Vy7n5dE6981ssuzNg/edit#gid=0">here</a>.

            <p>As of late December 2020, the TDR algorithms are in the process of undergoing a final screening to ensure they are speed-optimal. The expected average movecount of these algorithms is 9-10 STM, with most algorithms being RU and RUD. Preliminary simulations using the older algorithms gives a rough estimate of 26 moves for the finish, which is not much better than the individual OS paths, but this saves a recognition pause which is a major time saver.</p>

            <p>The solves using the TDR variation are fairly straight-forward, allowing the user to focus on few specific things like recognition, TPS, and EO-Ledge efficiency. The TDR algorithms are almost all sub-1-able, some being even quicker; and it is possible to look-ahead to the TDR case during EO-Ledge, minimising the pause before TDR. With sufficient advanced EO-ledge techniques, it is easily possible to achieve sub-45 average movecounts for this algorithm-based method, which in itself is a testiment to the potential of this variant.</p>
